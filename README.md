# Improving generalization via style transfer-based data augmentation: Novel regularization method

![Generated skin lesions: an example](https://github.com/AgaMiko/ST-DA/blob/master/Skin-lesions-examples.jpg)

## Introduction
Currently, deep learning  algorithms are considered as state-of-the-art in many classification tasks,
and yet the problem of weak generalization is very common, widely mentioned, and still up-to-date.

The present paper focuses most on the data augmentation. In our method, new images are synthetized with <em>neural style transfer (NST)</em>,
and the generated images are then used to train the convolutional neural network (CNN) in order to improve
its generalization abilities.  
The main contributions of this paper are:
*	The proposition of using <em>neural style transfer</em> for the data augmentation (ST-DA). This approach is presented on the skin lesion case study by transforming a benign skin lesion to a malignant lesion, and tested with dataset enrichment evaluation; 
*	Incorporating unlabeled, synthesized data into training by adding <em>pseudo-labels</em> generated by another CNN; 
*	Limiting the problem of noisy <em>pseudo-labels</em> in synthetic images used as a CNN training set by using only real images in validation and test sets;
*	Evaluating the ability to enrich the training dataset with artificially generated data with <em>Deep Taylor Decomposition</em>, 
* Proving that the ST-DA method significantly improves the performance and repeatability of training for deep neural networks.
